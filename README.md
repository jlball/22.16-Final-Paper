# 22.16-Final-Paper
Code used to perform calculations for my final paper in the 22.16 Nuclear Technology and Society class, taught by Prof. R. Scott Kemp in the spring of 2022.

This project is based off of the magnetic fusion reactor example developed by Jonathan Shimwell: https://github.com/fusion-energy/magnetic_fusion_openmc_dagmc_paramak_example

It makes use of OpenMC, Paramak, and DAGMC to create an approximate ARC-reactor blanket geometry and investigate its ability to breed fissile material, in order to assess proliferation risks from compact high field FLiBe blanketed tokamaks.
